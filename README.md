# Tom's Updater
The "Tom's Updater" program is a program that's downloaded by my other programs and called to update them. It does so by being called with a special program code that tells this program what ZIP packages to download and ultimately extract to disk and update your installation.

This program is not to be used by the public, it's more of a companion program for my other programs.
